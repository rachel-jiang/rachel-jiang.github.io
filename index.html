                                They are tall and slim, having a bigger appearance than their actual weight.
                                Their size however is dependent on their generation and gender. F1 hybrid male 
                                cats are usually the largest. F1 and F2 generations are usually the largest, 
                                as a result of serval's genetic influence. Similar to other hybrid cats, most 
                                of the first-generation cats will possess many of serval's exotic traits which 
                                would diminish in later generations. Males tend to be largar than females.
